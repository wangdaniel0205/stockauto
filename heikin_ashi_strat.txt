the candle height: the longer the candle the stronger the trend 

to make:
100 period moving average (consider from 20 - 100 period)

if cur_price > 100MA: consider it is uptrend and look for buy signals
else: consider ti is downtrend and look for sell signals

buy_signal: two heikin ashi candles with no wicks on the downside (two contious green), catch the one right after the pullback

	1. set buy order above the upper wick of the second candle
	2. set stop loss below the first candle
	3. set targets at the nearest resistance (or one risk reward ratio)


sell_signal: two heikin ashi candles with no wicks on the upside (two contious red), catch the one right after the pullback

	1. keep the stop loss above the high of the first candle
	2. exit at the near resistance (or one risk reward ratio)
